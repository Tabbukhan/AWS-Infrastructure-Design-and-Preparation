# 🔄 Dynamic Security Scanning with Rapid7 & AWS Lambda

Dynamic security scanning helps protect your production environments by continuously probing for real-world vulnerabilities that may exist despite static security measures. This approach simulates attacker behavior and ensures that security is not just theoretical, but practically validated in real-time.

---

## 💡 What is Dynamic Security Scanning?

No matter how rigorous your static code analysis is or how secure your deployment pipeline seems, **security can never be assumed—only validated**. Dynamic security scanning addresses this by:

- Simulating real-world attacks on live applications
- Continuously scanning production environments for vulnerabilities
- Evolving as fast as malicious actors and their tactics

---

## ⚠️ Challenges in Dynamic Security Scanning

- **System Stability**: Scanning live environments must not impact uptime or performance.
- **Granular Control**: It’s essential to define scan scope, frequency, and intensity.
- **Efficiency**: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) should be fast and provide actionable insights with minimal false positives.
- **Authentication Handling**: Applications with protected endpoints must be properly authenticated for accurate testing.
- **Scan Timing**: Scans should be scheduled to avoid impacting user experience.

## 🛠️ Key Tools for the Job

### 🧪 Rapid7 InsightAppSec

Rapid7 provides robust DAST capabilities via its InsightAppSec platform:

- Centralized dashboard to manage multiple application scans
- Support for authenticated scanning and protected endpoints
- Attack templates for OWASP Top 10, common stacks, and custom use cases
- Scheduled and manual testing support
- Actionable findings with detailed context
