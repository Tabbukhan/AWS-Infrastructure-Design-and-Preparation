# 🔐 Identity & Access Management (IAM) for Cloud Security

Managing **identity and access** is at the core of any secure, scalable cloud-native architecture. This document outlines how to handle diverse identity types and access policies using AWS IAM and tools like CyberArk to enforce the **principle of least privilege** across all layers of your cloud infrastructure.

---

## 🧾 Overview: What is IAM?

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** involves:

- Managing **who** (users, services, workloads) can **access what** (resources, APIs, systems)
- Applying **least-privilege access** and **zero-trust principles**
- Enabling secure, scalable, and auditable access to cloud infrastructure

In a cloud-native environment, identities may include:

- 👨‍💻 Internal users (developers, ops, admins)
- ⚙️ Application services and workloads
- 🌐 Third-party systems and end users

## ⚠️ Key Challenges

| Challenge                               | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌍 Decentralized Architecture          | Hard to enforce policies across services, APIs, and cloud accounts                           |
| 🔄 Credential Lifecycle Management      | Different identities have different credential rotation and access requirements              |
| ⚙️ Non-Interactive Identity Management | Workloads and automated systems need seamless and secure identity provisioning               |
| 🛡️ External Identity Providers         | Managing identities sourced from third-party providers (SSO, federation) adds complexity     |

## 🛠️ Key Tools for IAM Security

### 🧠 CyberArk

A cloud security tool that integrates with AWS IAM to provide:

- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**  
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Role Access**  
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**  
- **Automated risk and policy evaluation**

📌 Try it on [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace)

### 🔧 AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

AWS-native IAM provides:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- **Policy-based permissions** for services, APIs, and users  
- **Workload identity support** (e.g., roles for EC2, Lambda)  
- **Security Token Service (STS)** for temporary access

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up CyberArk

- Subscribe to **CyberArk** via the AWS Marketplace.
- Choose integrations: AWS STS console access, PAM services, or JIT access.

### Step 2: Define IAM Roles & Policies

- Create granular IAM roles and policies based on least-privilege access.
- Define **trust relationships** and **conditions** for context-aware access.

### Step 3: Secure Workload and Service Identities

- Attach IAM roles to services like **Lambda, EC2, and ECS**.
- Use short-lived tokens and rotate credentials automatically.

### Step 4: Monitor & Audit

- Integrate with **CloudTrail**, **Security Hub**, and **CyberArk dashboards**.
- Regularly review roles, users, and policies for over-permissioning.

## ✅ Best Practices for IAM Security

| Practice                          | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔒 Least-Privilege Access        | Grant only the permissions needed, nothing more                            |
| 🔁 Automate Credential Rotation  | Rotate secrets and tokens regularly                                        |
| 🧑‍💻 Role-Based Access (RBAC)      | Use roles instead of static users wherever possible                        |
| 🔍 Regular Auditing              | Detect unused roles, excessive privileges, and misconfigured trust policies|
| 🕒 Just-In-Time Access           | Use CyberArk to provision access only when needed                          |
| 🧾 Attribute-Based Access (ABAC) | Enhance flexibility using tags and conditions in policies                  |
