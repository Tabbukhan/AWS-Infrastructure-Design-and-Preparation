# 🔐 Security Scanning with Orca Security & AWS CodePipeline

## 🔎 Security Scanning Overview

Security scanning combines **static** and **dynamic** approaches to identify vulnerabilities throughout the application lifecycle:

- **Static Scanning**: Integrates into CI/CD pipelines to analyze code before deployment.
- **Dynamic Scanning**: Continuously probes live applications to simulate real-world threats.

Both approaches prioritize **precision** and **efficiency**, aiming to minimize false positives and provide actionable insights. This comprehensive strategy ensures protection from **development** through **production** environments.

## 🧱 Static Code Security Scanning

Static scanning is a key capability of the **"shift-left"** security model—detecting flaws early in the development process, long before release or promotion across environments.

### ⚠️ Challenges in Static Scanning:

- **Complex Codebases**: Most applications rely more on dependencies and open-source libraries than on original code, requiring deep analysis of all direct and transitive dependencies.
- **Constantly Evolving Threats**: The vulnerability landscape is ever-changing, requiring scanning tools to continuously update and compare against current databases.
- **Developer Integration**: Tooling must be seamlessly integrated into development workflows and CI/CD pipelines without slowing down build times.
- **False Positives**: Maintaining developer confidence requires accurate and relevant alerts that avoid unnecessary noise.

## 🔍 What is Orca Security?

[Orca Security](https://orca.security/) is a cloud-native security tool that provides deep, agentless security across your entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). It enables:

- Vulnerability and misconfiguration detection  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning  
- Container image and codebase analysis  
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA)  
- DevSecOps policy enforcement and reporting  

---

## ⚙️ What is AWS CodePipeline?

[AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) is a fully managed CI/CD service that automates the build, test, and deploy phases of your release process. With CodePipeline, you can:

- Define pipelines as code  
- Automate software delivery workflows  
- Integrate third-party tools like Orca with ease  

---

## 🚀 Integration Overview

By integrating Orca Security into AWS CodePipeline, you can shift security left by adding scanning steps into your release lifecycle. The benefits include:

- Early detection of vulnerabilities  
- Continuous compliance checks  
- Scalable and automated security enforcement  

---

## 🧪 Getting Started

### 1. Sign Up for Orca Security

- Visit the [Orca Security AWS Marketplace page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) and subscribe using your AWS account.

### 2. Configure Your Pipeline

- Add a custom step in your **AWS CodePipeline** to trigger a scan using Orca's API.
- Ensure proper IAM permissions and API tokens are configured for secure integration.

**Example flow:**

Source ➝ Build ➝ Orca Security Scan ➝ Deploy



---

## 📌 Notes

- Orca supports scanning a variety of artifacts including IaC files, Docker images, and source code.
- Integration can be extended to other tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI/CD as needed.
- You can define policies in Orca to automatically fail pipeline stages when critical issues are found.
